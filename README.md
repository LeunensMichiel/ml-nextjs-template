# Michiel Leunens -- Next.js template

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

To run a production build, run:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Formatting and Linting

This template makes use of `Husky`, which will run `es-lint` and `prettier` automatically before each commit.
In case you want to run these commands manually, you can do as follows:

```bash
yarn lint
```

```bash
yarn format
```
